# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
This app uses the input of a US city zip code to display city's temperature. It also displays the user's feeling if he chooses to write it, and an apropriate error messsage will show up if zip code or feelings aren't entered.
Dependencies: Created with MS VS code with node.js (express, cors & body-parser) installed.
